# bloc-notes
A react-powered notepad to get the hang of how the framework works.

It's online [here](https://tgianella.github.io/bloc-notes/) if you want to check it out.

It is your run of the mill notepad, nothing too fancy but a few things are worth noting :
- Perfect synchronization between user input and note display in real time, thanks to useState
- The data persists in localstorage (so you can actually use it as a real app !)
